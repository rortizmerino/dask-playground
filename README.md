# Dask playground

**Purpose**

This repository provides an example of a software project compliant with the [FAIR principles.](https://fair-software.nl/). It also adopts the recommendations made by the [TU Delft Guidelines on Research Software](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/TUDelft/Over_TU_Delft/Strategie/TU%20Delft%20Research%20Software%20Guidelines.pdf).

This repository includes documentation and examples on how to use [Dask]() locally, and using High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters such as [snellius]() and [DelftBlue]()

## Installation

[Describe the steps  that users (not developers) should follow to install the code in each of the intended platforms (e.g. Window 10, MacOS, etc.).]

**Requirements** 
- [List the software, OS, and/or technologies on which the code depends, and add hyperlinks to the sources whenever possible.]
- [State any relevant hardware requirements.]

### Local installation

[List and describe each step required to install the software. Use a description/example format. For example:]

[1. Install dependencies ]

Create environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Load environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Full installation from requirements
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step-wise installation
```bash
python3 -m pip install "dask[complete]"
python3 -m pip install pytest
python3 -m pip install jupyterlab
python3 -m pip install xarray
python3 -m pip install pooch
python3 -m pip install cftime
```

Reminder in case more packages are installed
```bash
python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Test dask installation
```bash
py.test .venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/dask
```

Test xarray installation
```bash
py.test .venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/xarray
```

Setup jupyter lab
```bash
jupyter lab --generate-config
```
